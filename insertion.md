# Insertion-Sort-Project
 Basic insertion sort examples
## List : [22,27,16,2,18,6] 
## Step1 - Write the smallest of the above sequence
[2,27,16,22,18,6]
> Do the same for remmainig numbers for the second order of the list
[2,6,16,22,18,27] . . . [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]

## Step 2 - Big-O notation
 * O(n^2)
## Question : What is the complexity of 18 after the list is sorted?
* Average Case
